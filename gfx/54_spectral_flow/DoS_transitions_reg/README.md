Fig. 5.23 is `./plots/skx_DoS_transitions_reg01.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./skx_DoS_transitions_reg01.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1701265911', '1701273077', '1701346006'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_shifts_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_mags_kpm.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.
