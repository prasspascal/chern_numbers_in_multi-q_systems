# Creating figures for Section 6.4.

Fig. 6.10 a) and Fig. 6.10 b) are `./plots/max_DOS_flux.png` and `./plots/flux_DOS_max.png` which were generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./max_flux_DoS+Chern+Morb_fermi_kpm.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1711446659', '1711446760'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_flux_kpm.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.

Fig. 6.11 is `./plots/max_flux_Chernhierarchy_kpm_morb.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./max_flux_DoS+Chern+Morb_fermi_kpm.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1747966516', '1747966516', '1711446760', '1711446659'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py`, `/code/2D/run_flux_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_chern_fermi.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.

## Spin textures
Fig. 6.9 was generated using the files in `./spin_textures`.
