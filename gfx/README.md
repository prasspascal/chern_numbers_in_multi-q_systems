# Figures

Each folder contains the data sets and Python/Mathematica scripts to generate the figures and tables for the corresponding section of the thesis.

## Data analysis, figures, and tables
`/gfx/**/data` contain data generated by the code in `/code`.
The respective input parameters are recorded in `*/params.json`

To reproduce the data analysis and to generate the figures and tables use the Jupyter notebook `.ipynb` files.

## Additional graphics
Other graphics were generated in the Mathematica notebook files `.nb` and modified with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) in the `.xcf` files
