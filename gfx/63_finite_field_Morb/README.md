Fig. 6.7 is `./plots/skx_flux_Chernhierarchy_kpm_morb.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./skx_flux_DoS+Chern+Morb_fermi_kpm.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1747908879', '1747908879', '1709931786', '1710322977'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py`, `/code/2D/run_flux_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_chern_fermi.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.
