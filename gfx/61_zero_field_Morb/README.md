# Creating figures for Section 6.1.

Fig. 6.1 is `./plots/skx_Chernhierarchy_kpm_morb.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./skx_DoS+Chern+Morb_fermi_kpm_0shift0mag.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1700658946', '1700736286', '1717783204'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_chern_fermi.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.

Fig. 6.2 a) is `./plots/skx_Chernhierarchy_phaseshift_0mag_morb.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./skx_DoS+Chern+Morb_phaseshift_0mag.ipynb`.
