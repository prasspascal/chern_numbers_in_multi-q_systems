# Creating figures for Section 5.3.

## Density of states transitions
Fig. 5.11 and Fig. 5.12 were generated using the files in `./DOS_transitions`.

## Shifted Chern hierarchies
Fig. 5.14 and Fig. 5.16 were generated using the files in `./DOS+Chern_fermi_kpm_pishift0mag`.

Fig. 5.15 and Fig. 5.17 were generated using the files in `./DOS+Chern_fermi_kpm_0shiftXmag`.

## Chern transitions
Fig. 5.19 and Fig. 5.20 were generated using the files in `./DOS+Chern_transitions`.

## Chern diagrams
Fig. 5.12 and Fig. 5.22 were generated using the files in `./Chern_diagram`.

## Spin textures
Fig. 5.13 and Fig. 5.18 were generated using the files in `./spin_textures`.
