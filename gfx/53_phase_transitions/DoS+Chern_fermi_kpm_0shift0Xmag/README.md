## Shifted Chern hierarchies

Fig. 5.15 is `./plots/skx_Chernhierarchy_kpm_0shift07mag.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./skx_DoS+Chern_fermi_kpm_0shift07mag.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1700742378', '1701277931', '1700567128'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_chern_fermi.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.

Fig. 5.17 is `./plots/sin_Chernhierarchy_kpm_0shift-05mag.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./sin_DoS+Chern_fermi_kpm_0shift-05mag.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1727751452', '1727609208', '1727711235'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_chern_fermi.py`.
