## Shifted Chern hierarchies

Fig. 5.14 is `./plots/skx_Chernhierarchy_kpm_pishift0mag.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./skx_DoS+Chern_fermi_kpm_pishift0mag.ipynb`.
The corresponding data sets can be found in `./data/*` with `*` from `'1700700779', '1701007132', '1700398029'` and were produced using the python scripts `/code/2D/run_theta_kpm.py` and `/code/2D/run_chern_fermi.py`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `./data/*/params.json`.

Fig. 5.16 is `./plots/sin_Chernhierarchy_kpm_pishift0mag.png` which was generated in the Jupyter notebook file `./sin_DoS+Chern_fermi_kpm_pishift0mag.ipynb`.
